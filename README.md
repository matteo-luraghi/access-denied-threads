# access-denied-threads
A C scrpit based on the problem https://open.kattis.com/problems/accessdenied which uses two different threads to act as the "hacker" and the "hacked"

To compile and run the code in Linux just use the following commands in the same directory as the file: 
```
gcc accessdenied.c -o accessdenied
./accessdenied
```
